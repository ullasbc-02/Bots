You can also specify a range of cells to iterate through, for example:


for row in sheet['A1:C3']:
   for cell in row:
       value = cell.value
       print(value)


This will iterate through the cells in the range A1:C3.

Using pandas, you can read an Excel file into a dataframe and then iterate through the cells in the dataframe. For example:

import pandas as pd

# Read the Excel file into a dataframe
df = pd.read_excel('filename.xlsx')

# Iterate through the rows in the dataframe
for index, row in df.iterrows():
   # Iterate through the cells in the row
   for value in row:
       print(value)


This will print the value of each cell in the dataframe. You can also access specific cells using the df.loc[] method, for example:

value = df.loc[0, 'column_name']

This will return the value in the first row and the column with the name "column_name".
